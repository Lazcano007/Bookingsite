# Booking App - (Frontend Documentation)
This is the frontend to the bookingsystem. It was built with **VITE**, **TypeScript** and **React**, and it communicates with the backend API and manages users, admin and bookings

---
## Tech-Stack

- **TypeScript**
- **React**
- **VITE**
- **AXIOS**
- **SCSS**

## Getting Started
To run the project locally, follow the steps below:

1) Open up the "BookingApp" folder you created earlier when you cloned the project from github.

2) Once inside "BookingApp". Type in this command ```cd Frontend```. This navigates you to the frontend folder.

3) Inside the frontend folder you type in this command ```npm install```. It installs everything you need to run the frontend on your computer.

4) Lastly you'll need to type in this command ```npm run dev```. This runs the frontend project. Just make sure that the backend project is running as well otherwise it's not going to work.

## Figma Design
Here is my figma design showing my initial layout and idea for the application: [Figma-desing (frontend)](https://www.figma.com/design/cuTy2tHXsIv8i72OqglGgM/U10-BOKNINGSAPP?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=QBsWaFGaHa3MMRDT-0)

---
## Deployment
I decided to deploy the frontend on netlify and connected to the backend deployment on render: [Booking App (frontend)](https://fresh-line-barbers.netlify.app/)

---
## Code-Standard
The frontend is formatted with **Prettier** to ensure consistent styling in TypeScript and SCSS.
